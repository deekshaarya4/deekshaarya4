Deeksha Arya is a PhD student in computer Science at McGill University. Her research focuses on the current software documentation landscape and its role in the education of computer science. She also is interested in the application of natural language processing and machine learning in software engineering research to help programmers learn software technologies.

In 2019, Deeksha completed her M.Sc. in Computer Science at McGill University. In her thesis, she studied the information correspondence between API reference documentation and tutorials, to inform further software documentation research with insights on the content of software documentation. It is also useful for documentation creators and writers to be aware of patterns that exist in the documentation, so they may be leveraged to ensure information across documentation types is consistent.

Prior to this, Deeksha worked for three years at Infibeam.com, after having received her B.E. in Information Science from M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology.

Deeksha is also a professional Indian classical dancer, having trained in Bharatanatyam for over 20 years and in Mohiniattam for seven. She also loves to travel, and her weekends are packed with dance and destinations.
