Deeksha Arya is a PhD graduate from the [The McGill Software Technology Lab](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~martin/students.html) at the School of Computer Science, McGill University. She was supervised by Professors [Jin Guo](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/) and [Martin Robillard](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~martin/). Her research focuses on the software documentation landscape, specifically how to design documentation to cater to varied information needs without overwhelming documentation creators. She is also interested in the meaningful application of natural language processing and machine learning in software engineering research to help programmers learn software technologies. Her larger research goal is to determine how to leverage documentation resources to teach students without access to systematic computer science education, about software engineering and its concepts.

In 2019, Deeksha completed her M.Sc. in Computer Science at McGill University. In her thesis, she studied the information correspondence between API reference documentation and tutorials, to provide insight on the complementary content in different documentation types.

Prior to this, Deeksha worked for three years at Infibeam.com, after having received her B.E. in Information Science from M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology.

Deeksha is also a professional Indian classical dancer, having trained in Bharatanatyam for over 25 years and in Mohiniattam for ten. She also loves to travel, and her weekends are packed with dance and destinations.
